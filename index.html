                    Just an ordinary guy from Cairo, Georgia doing extraordinary things. Football was my life from age 5 to
                    age 24.
                    I can't not express enough gratitude towards the sport that evolved me into the person I am today. I've
                    battled
                    hardships, from tearing my ACL in college to being diagnosed with sleep apnea. However, I wake up every
                    day ready
                    to battle whatever obstacles that may arise.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    On a lighter note, I enjoy weightlifting, creating graphic desgins, and playing video games (Xbox). If
                    you would
                    like to add me as a friend on Xbox, my gamertag is DeuceLafetti. Anyways, I received my undergraduate
                    degree in
                    Computer Science at the University of the South and earned a MBA from Berry College. Currently, I work
                    at Chick-fil-A
                    Inc. as an IT Analyst. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    With much interest in automation, I am looking to learn as much as I can to better serve
                    the industry. Feel free to roam around and check out my portfolio!
